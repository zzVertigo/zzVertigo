### Hi, I'm zzVertigo

I'm a software developer who is passionate for creating private servers for all sorts of games and services. Most of my work is done in C# however, I have expanded into other languages such as NodeJS, Python and C++.

Some projects I am working on right now is a Clash of Clans, Need For Speed: Underground and Halo: Online private server. From time to time I also work on my very own operating system VertexOS.

Feel free to contact me on Discord (zzVertigo#2001) or by email (zzvertigo1@gmail.com)
