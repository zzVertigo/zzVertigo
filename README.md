### Hi, I'm zzVertigo

I'm a software developer who is passionate for creating private servers for all sorts of games and services. Most of my work is done in C# however, I have expanded into other languages such as NodeJS, Python and C++. I am currently in schooling for computer sciences and plan to pursue backend engineering as a long term career.

Feel free to contact me on Discord (zzVertigo#7134) or by email (zz@vertigo.rocks)
