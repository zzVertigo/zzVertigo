### Hi, I'm zzVertigo

I'm a software developer who is passionate for creating private servers for all sorts of games and services. Most of my work is done in C# however, I have expanded into other languages such as NodeJS, Python and C++. I am currently in schooling for computer sciences and plan to pursue backend engineering as a long term career.

Some private server projects I am working on right now are:
- The Matrix Online (MMO)
- Star Wars: The Old Republic (MMO)
- Halo: Online (FPS)
- Call of Duty: Online (FPS)

From time to time I also work on my very own operating system VertexOS however progress has been quite slow recently.

Feel free to contact me on Discord (zzVertigo#2001) or by email (zzvertigo1@gmail.com)
